## Coursework

- A Student Accommodation Service helps university students to find properties to rent
in the city in which they are studying. An information system is required to help the
Service maintain lists of landlords, their properties and of students seeking
accommodation.
All of the properties are owned by private landlords; each property is owned by one
landlord, though some landlords own several properties. The name, address and
telephone number of landlords are kept. When new properties are added to the system,
they are allocated a unique identifying number and details are taken of the address,
type of property (for example, flat, terraced house, detached house), the maximum
number of tenants it is suitable for and the amount of the rent.
Landlords are charged a fee for each property that is added to the system. Students
seeking accommodation have to register with the Service providing their name, current
address, telephone number, their date of birth and gender. Once registered a student
can be provided with a list of available properties. If a student makes a request to view
a property, the Service arranges a viewing with the landlord. Details are kept of each
viewing that is arranged including the date on which it took place and which student,
or students were involved (friends often seek accommodation together).
Landlords notify the Service when a property is no longer available for rent and when
a property is once again available. In both cases the Service updates the property file
so that students seeking accommodation can be given an accurate list.
Tasks
- The aim of this coursework is to analyse the above case study to design and develop
a database in Microsoft SQL Server including high data integrity and data validation to
facilitate the following.

  1. Allow the administrative staff to enter and maintain details about all the project
activities. Your application should include appropriate data validation
mechanisms (constraints), triggers and user defined functions.

  2. Allow authorized parties to view details to generate meaningful management
reports to make strategic, long term and short-term managerial decisions. Your
application should include appropriate views and stored procedures to
retrieve operational data.
